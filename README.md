# movemouse

I was using a USB mouse mover/jiggler device to prevent my work computer from screen lock. After done some researches on the Internet, I was able to come up a small Python code to do the same thing as the hardware.
The code regularly generates a mouse event to Windows by moving the mouse to the same place where it is, so it will not affect your use of the computer. After running this Python code, your Windows will never get screen locked. 
Exit the program will come back to normal, so don't forget to close the application when you are done of the work. :)

To run the code, in Windows, open a command line, and enter to the directory which contains movemouse.py, and run:
python movemouse.py
or
python3 movemouse.py

make sure python is installed in your computer.
